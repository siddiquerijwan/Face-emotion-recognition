🎭 Real-Time Face Emotion Detection using CNN
This project is a real-time facial emotion detection system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with OpenCV and Keras/TensorFlow. The system detects faces from live webcam input and classifies emotions into categories such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, etc.  multi-face detection and group emotion analysis.

📌 Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV.

Emotion classification using a trained CNN model.

User-friendly interface to visualize results live.

Customizable emotion categories.

Well-structured and beginner-friendly code.

🚀 Getting Started

2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the Model (Optional)
If you want to train the model from scratch:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/train_model.py
Make sure the dataset (e.g., FER2013) is properly downloaded and placed in the dataset/ directory.

4. Run Real-Time Detection
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
🧪 Dataset
The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset, which consists of 48x48 grayscale images labeled with 7 emotion classes.

📊 Model Architecture
Input: 48x48 grayscale images

Conv2D -> ReLU -> MaxPooling (x3)

Flatten -> Dense -> Dropout -> Dense(Softmax)

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
